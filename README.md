AI-powered Terminal: A smart command-line interface that transforms natural language prompts into executable Linux commands. It can also generate, execute, and manage code files dynamically, streamlining development and automation workflows. By integrating AI, our terminal enhances efficiency, reduces manual effort, and simplifies complex tasks for developers and system administrators.

## Feature Overview
### Core Functionality
**Understand & Execute User Prompts**:
- Converts natural language prompts into executable Linux commands.
- Runs the generated command seamlessly.
  
**Error Handling & Recovery**:
- If a command fails, the error message is appended to the input, and the AI regenerates the response with corrections.
- If essential details are missing (e.g., missing file path in touch filename), the system prompts the user for additional input before proceeding.

**Seamless Normal Command Execution**:
- Built-in detection mechanism for standard Linux commands.
- Direct execution without invoking the AI when unnecessary.
  
**Server Logging**:
- All command executions and interactions are logged for debugging, analysis, and tracking.
  
### Enhancements
**Command Chaining & Piping**:
- Ability to execute sequential commands or chain outputs using pipes (input | prompt | output).
- Bug-Free Code Generation & Execution:
- Generate and run code files while ensuring they are error-free.
